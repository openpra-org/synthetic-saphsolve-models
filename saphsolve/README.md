Currently, the generated models are fault tree models. The configurations are listed below. Although 14 options are available for customizing fault trees, the following three arguments are preferred to create fault trees in different formats:

- **The number of basic events**
- **Maximum probability for basic events**
- **Minimum probability for basic events**
