# Synthetic SAPHSOLVE Models

This repository includes synthetic models in SAPHSOLVE JSON format. The goals of including these models are to:

- Serve as test cases for various PRA tools, including [Open-PRA](https://github.com/openpra-org/openpra-monorepo).
- Familiarize users with different modeling approaches and formats.
- Provide a reference for PRA model exchange.
- And more.

The repository also maintains a `schema` for the models to give users valuable insights.

## 1. SAPHSOLVE Model Format


## 2. Generation of Models
Models are generated leveraging [fault tree generator](https://github.com/rakhimov/scram/tree/develop/scripts)
developed under [SCRAM](https://github.com/rakhimov/scram)

## 3. Configuration of Models
Currently, the generated models are fault tree models. The configurations are listed below. Although 14 options are available for customizing fault trees, the following three arguments are preferred to create fault trees in different formats:

- **The number of basic events**
- **Maximum probability for basic events**
- **Minimum probability for basic events**

## 4. Usage
These models can be used to test quantification engines. Additionally, they enable the creation of a verification platform between quantification engines, allowing developers or practitioners to cross-check their results. Moreover, these models serve as a foundation for benchmarking efforts for any quantification tool.
